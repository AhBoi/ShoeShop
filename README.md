# ShoeShop
Idk i did this for school using Python 3.
800 lines of code, full working shop, took around 8h.
May have some glitches here and there but i tried my best to debug every thing i could...soo help me if you want to.
You may use the code for ur own personal projects, but i personaly belive that i could have compressed the codes better, but it was my first time...sooo DON'T JUDGE >:(
